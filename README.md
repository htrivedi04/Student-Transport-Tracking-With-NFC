# Student-Transport-Tracking-With-NFC
Major Project for B.Tech at GGSIPU. The project involves tracking the in and out activities of the students in the college transport through NFC IDs and NFC Android application in an NFC-enabled reader device. The reader is not only capable of reading in-out timings but can also generate new student IDs for a bus route based on their Enroll Nos.
